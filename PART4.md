## Library Management System - Setup and Testing

### Setup

The system should behave as follows:

1. **Add a Book**
   - Use the `add` command to add a book.
   - Input the title of the book when prompted.

2. **Search for a Book**
   - Use the `search` command to search for a book.
   - If the book is **found**, the system will confirm that it is available.
   - If the book is **not found**, the system will prompt to add the book and then allow you to add it before proceeding.

3. **Borrow a Book**
   - Use the `borrow` command to borrow a book.
   - Input the title of the book to borrow.

4. **Return a Book**
   - Use the `return` command to return a borrowed book.
   - Input the title of the book to return.

5. **Exit the Program**
   - Use the `exit` command to exit the program.
